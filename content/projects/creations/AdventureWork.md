This project is about designing and delivering a professional-quality, end-to-end business intelligence solution using Microsoft Power BI.


I'll be working through the entire business intelligence workflow:

1. Connecting and shaping the source data
2. Building a relational model
3. Adding calculated columns and measures
4. Designing an interactive report
